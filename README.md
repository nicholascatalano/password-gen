# Password Generator

## Description
In this project, my goal was to create a random password generator that used inputs from the user.

#### Install
No install necessary; please visit [nicholascatalano.github.io/passwor](https://nicholascatalano.github.io/password-gen/)https://nicholascatalano.github.io/password-gen/

#### Use
To generate a random password, click the Generate Password button, then follow the prompts that pop up on the screen. Once the final prompt (special characters) is compeleted, a password should generate within the box on the screen. You should be able to copy and paste that password as well.
